# Udacity Dinosaur Project

## Starting Point

I've started with the given Starter Code from Udacity.
It contained and almost finished Html and Css File.

## The Task

The Task was to create Dino Objects from a Sourcefile and compare them to
Human Data from userinput through a form.
After completing the form it should disappear and show a grid of different
dinosaurs with random facts. A human tile appears in the middle with descriptive
text.
